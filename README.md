# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back-end programming for a What to Wear (WTWR) app. The project creates a RESTful API using express.js, Node.js and MongoDB. The databases store user information and documents describing individual items of clothing, each linked to an individual owner by \_id. Users are able to create, edit, delete and find documents by \_id.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
